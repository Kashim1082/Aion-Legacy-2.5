# Aion-Legacy-2.7

Hello,

We decided to create a github repository for people to check & monitor issues status.
Here you report bugs found on the server.

Current list and priority :

:fleur_de_lis: New Client Game Files:fleur_de_lis: 

Right now im uploading a new Aion legacy client to my drive, i will share it here and update the links in the website, with this client these issues will be added / fixed:

:small_orange_diamond: Portal entrances to instances, aka, Fire temple, Draupnir Cave, Udas Temple, Lower Udas etc.
:small_orange_diamond: Client stability, less send log issues, less crashes inside instances, you can have aion on full screen and tab now, before you had sendlogs while doing this

Additional Information:bangbang: 

With these new Game Files, the server will become a 2.7 one, that means we will have the arena system implemented along with all the 2.7 changes. At the moment that content wont work, our goal is to fix above issues first.

We will be slowly updating the server with the fixes, no ETA atm.
